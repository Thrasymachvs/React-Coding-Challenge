# React-Coding-Challenge
Learning React, without trying to Over-React

TO RUN:

It can all be run locally by downloading the HTML file and running it in-browser; it uses CDN to pull all of the necessary .js files.

Currently, it all runs as a single HTML file, with no descript distinction between a front-end/back-end. I'm working on integrating with Node 
and making a more clearly defined front/back-end for communication, but wanted to push an initial build for progress. 

It's not pretty, because I wanted to spend initial focus on getting the fundamentals working.
